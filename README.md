# Dog Vision (A Deep Learning Journey into Dog Breed Classification)
Welcome to Dog Vision, a fascinating deep learning project that explores the world of computer vision and machine learning. 

# Project overview

## Project Description
Welcome to the Dog Vision project, an exploration of computer vision and machine learning. In this project, we aimed to develop an end-to-end multi-class dog breed classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub. This journey led us through the intricacies of deep learning, transfer learning, and fine-tuning pre-trained models.

### Key Highlights:

- Data Preprocessing and Augmentation.
- Model Building and Training.
- Evaluation Metrics and Validation.
- TensorFlow Hub Integration.
Join us as we dive into the world of dog breed classification, share our code, and reveal insights into the fascinating domain of artificial intelligence. Explore the power of pre-trained models and the potential for real-world applications. Let's unleash the possibilities together!"

## Setup
This project was run using the google colab laboratory because of the big size of data used for training/evaluation and also the computing power needed to run the project. All the dependencies needed were downloaded and utilized directly on the google colaboratory. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run the Dog Breed Classification project on Google Colab. Follow these instructions to get started.
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
A Google account
Access to Google Colab (available at [Google Colab](colab.research.google.com).)
### Usage
You can easily run the Dog Breed Classification project on Google Colab. Here's how:
- Open a web browser and go to Google Colab.
- Log in with your Google account. If you don't have one, you can create one for free.
- Click on "File" in the Colab menu.
- Select "Open Notebook."
- Choose the "GitHub" tab.
- Enter the URL of this GitHub repository. ```git clone https://github.com/Dee-ui/dog-vision-project.git```
- Select the ```dog-vision.ipynb``` notebook from the repository.
- Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the project in the Colab environment. You can run code cells, view outputs, and interact with the project directly in your web browser.
